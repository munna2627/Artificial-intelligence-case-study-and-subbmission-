Recently, I worked on an AI-driven case focused on airline punctuality, not by cutting prices, but by outthinking complexity.

Here’s the real insight:

Punctuality isn’t a scheduling problem. It’s a data problem.

In an airline, everything is interconnected:

Aircraft rotation
Crew rest regulations
Ground operations (fueling, cleaning, boarding, baggage)
Customer behaviour at check-in and boarding

Using concepts from Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Predictive Analytics, the challenge was to design a system that:

Detects delays before they happen
Separates human error from system noise
Uses AI to support decisions, not blindly automate them

This is exactly where my Master’s in Big Data & Business Intelligence comes alive:

Turning raw operational data into actionable insight.
Designing systems that balance automation with human judgment.
Solving business problems where seconds matter and margins are thin.

Airlines don’t win by being cheaper anymore.
They win by being smarter, more reliable, and more predictable.
And that’s what good data + good AI is really about.
